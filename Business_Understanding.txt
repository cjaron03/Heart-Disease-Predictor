Early detection of heart disease is extremely important because cardio vascular condtions 
often progress silently until they cause severe, sometimes even fatal, events such as heart attacks or heart failure
Predictive tools that flag elevated risk before symptioms become severe can support earlier lifestyle changes
follow-up testing, and clinical interventions, potentially reducing morbidity nad mortality.
A system like ours can benefit primary care providers, and indvidual pateins who want a data-driven snapshot of their cardiovasular 
risk profile.

In this project, we aim to answer questions like: which clinical and lifestyle indicators most storngly predict heart disease,
how accurately tree-based models (Decision Tree and Random Forest) can classify patiens into "disease" vs "no deases", 
and whether we can desgin a simple, user-friendly Heart Risk Advisor that turns model outputs into understandable, educational
